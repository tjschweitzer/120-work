# Week 6

### Steps taken this Week
 This week we covered a lot of tricks for coding that honestly would have made my project from week 5 a little easier. I was able to use the constrain method to my advantage to save a lot of space on coding. I do plan to take what I learned and recode my week 5 project to make the code cleaner

 ### Problems
 I ran in to an issue with just a personal lack of inspiration. I spent a lot of time trying and although I am not as satisfied with my project as I am my last few. I feel that this one at least gets better the longer it runs.
