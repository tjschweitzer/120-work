# HW 10 | Better Dragon Scales!

### What I did this week
I took my week 8 project and was able to rework the 2d array that I had of custom classes to just a 3 dementional arrya this saved alot of memor/processing time and it acually seems to have casued a quite notable speed increase.
functions and arrays are ssomething I had already been using in my older projects so i took this week as a chance to improve my code to be more efficent

### Hard parts

I had some challenges at first untill I was able to  figure out how to make the three dementional arrays

### MISC

I was able to help Avery (aschave19) With some coding issues for this weeks work.
