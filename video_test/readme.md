# Spring 2019 Final
## Computer Vision

### My Process
I started by trying to find some videos for computer vision in p5.js. The only videos I was able to find were processing videos from the coding train. So I used those videos and had to convert the code to p5.
My first code attempt was made to work with a web cam and would just track the brightest point on the screen and was only able to track one point at a time. I wanted to make my code take in a video and track some color. I then ran in to an issue with the fact that the only thing I have that does video was my web cam and phone; neither did it well. I was able to rent a DSLR camera from the University that would record video.  I then filmed my roommate and I spinning fire a few different days  to get the best set up for it.
It took a lot to try and get the code to detect a single point. I then had to convert my code to do blob detection so it would change the size of the point tracked. After this I had to make it track multiple points as an array.  I got stuck at this point unsure of what to do, I met with the TA Stephanie to get help on how to superimpose the video file on the canvas and make other changes.
This helped a lot and I was able to get the program working the way I was happy with.

### Failures
~I wanted to have the ability to change the video file it was playing. I was not able to get that working the way I wanted, then I ran in to the same issue with sound files.
I also wanted to get the color of the blobs to change based on the different sounds in the songs, the color always ended up looking dull and not want I wanted. I ended up just having it do a basic change in the color based on the volume of the music playing .
-I wanted to have the ability for you to click and for it to track more than one color.  However, with the fire being the only source of light the colors in the video didn't have enough verity for it to work well.

### Successes
I was able to get the blob tracking to work and for it to work on multiple points, the color of the blobs will slightly change in a way that keeps the colors in the range I enjoy. I was able to get  the frame of the image to appear behind the blobs.
I was also able to make it so you can use the arrow keys to change the alpha level of the image and the overall max distance between the blobs.
