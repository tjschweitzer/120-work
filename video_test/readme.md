# Spring 2019 Final Proposal

## The Subject
my plan for the final project is to try and have my code track one or two bright points made from some led light toys or some fire tools I have and track them while incorporating music to them.
## Related work and inspiration
I have seen color tracking and bright point tracking done so this could be along the same lines for the first part. My inspiration is that me and my friends do this type of performing along and finding a new way to share it would be fun.
## Possible problems.
Getting the code to track two points may end up being the biggest problem I run in to But I think even just one point will work out well.
 I am not sure if point tracking and playing music will be to intensive for p5 js script.

## My plan
I have already started on creating the color tracking past of the code and I should be able to get that going then I will just need to find out how I want the other overlays to happen.

## Done so far
I have some good test code made and I have checked out a dsr that shoots video that will help me get clean video to analyze.
