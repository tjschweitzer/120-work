# Week 4 Review

### What I Did
 - After reading and watching though all of the content for this week, I had the difficult decision to make of whether to make a monster or an even more *terrifying* self-portrait.
 - I looked though the majority of the examples provided to try and get some inspiration on how to start this creation.
 -  I decided to start with making a face and that could help me decide if it was a monster or a self-portrait.
 -  While looking up code on jp5s.original I came across an example that showed how to change the color of an object on mouse click and this inspired me to so a self-portrait with my hair changing color on each click. [Interactivity 1 example](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-interactivity-1.html)

 ### Problems
 1. The first problem I ran in to was placement of the different parts on the face, for example i feel like the arc command the start and stopping points for the circle seem to be revered from where I expected them to be
 2. I feel that the fact the rotate command rotates the entire grid makes placement or rotated objects just a big guessing game.
 3. The final problem that was just user error I had was i wrote a whole section of code outside of the draw end bracket and couldn’t for the life of me figure out why it wasn’t showing up for a good 10 min.
