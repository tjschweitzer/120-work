# HW 8 | Dragon Scales!

### What I did this week

We went over while and for loops. After watching all the videos and reading all the information. I was excited to be able to use a lot more of my coding knowledge

### Hard parts

I wanted to be able to use a 2d or 3 d array to be able to track the colors of all the objects in this project. I found the way p5 initializes arrays to be very counter intuitive and now work as well as any other programing language i have used. I was unable to make a 3d array and ended up just making a 2d array of objects.
