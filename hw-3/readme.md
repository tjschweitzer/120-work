# HW-3

I was more then excited to start the p5.js coding!, where I was able to see the traditional Hello world code on the screen.
Being able to dupicate the expty example folder in Atom really made everything alot easier.
Commenting my code is something I have had a hard time with in previous classes, but just knowing the hot key to be able to auto-comment in a comment I think will make a big difference for me.

One thing I would like to get a better idea of is how much commenting is appropriate once we get to the point where were not just doing it to show a basic understanding of coding?

## Issues?
Overall I didnt run in to any problems with this assignment but I will be keeping an eye out for any posts in the class repo I can help with.
