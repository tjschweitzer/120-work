### Stuff I did This Week

This weeks assignment endedup being a lot simpler for me then I thought it was going to be.
After watching all the videos and reading up on some referance material. I was able to start on the project and get it all taken care of in one setting.
 My previous experance with other Object Oriented languages were an advantage.

 ### Issues?

 I didnt end up having any issues this week with what I did. I was able to get my ghosts at act correctly after one or two tries.
